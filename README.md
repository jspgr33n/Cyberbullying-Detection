# Overview

<strong> Detecting Cyberbullying:
Andrew Chung, James Park </strong>

People use social media and the internet on a day-to-day basis, including a vast majority of children and teenagers. 
With the rise of COVID-19 and more people spending time online, cyberbullying has reached an all time high. Since we are college students, 
we thought that this was a serious and significant topic to look deeper into. Through models such as kNN, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and 
other transformer models such as BERT, we use data from Kaggle to train our models and classify cyberbullying and non-cyberbullying on the internet.
